# Hackster.io.Lifx
This will be the source repo for an article on Hackster.io on controlling Lifx lights from a Windows 10 UWP application.  It will also have a Windows 10 IoT UWP component to turn on some night lights when motion is detected in a room.

This is a work in progress currently and should not be considered a working project at this time.
